How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

git diff f19cb1b80fe27e938e4d72770ca0a42f25e99ecc 75928a98e18479b22b18888a33d36379f17b43c1

compare with u:
diff -u name name

move file: mv

Copy file: cp

Create directory: mkdir

git diff ID ID
git clone URL
git checkout ID
git log
git scp (secure copy from one computer to another)

to see all hidden files in directory:  ls -a
