How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

git diff f19cb1b80fe27e938e4d72770ca0a42f25e99ecc 75928a98e18479b22b18888a33d36379f17b43c1

compare with u:
diff -u name name

move file: mv

Copy file: cp

Create directory: mkdir

git init  (initializes the repository)
git diff (ID ID)
git diff (with no arguments, compares working directory and the staging area)
git clone (URLgit checkout ID)
git log
git scp (secure copy from one computer to another)
git add
git commit
git status
git diff —staged (compares staging area to commit 1)
git reset —reset

to see all hidden files in directory:  ls -a
